# Conslist
## Implementation of ReduceByKey via Conslist <br>
Using the three methods we compared the time taken for them to run the same text file sample measured in nano seconds(ns) <br>
Using the iterative method we implicitly expolit the immutable nature of the conslist unlike the other two methods.<br>

OUTPUT:
               Benchmark Test Table
